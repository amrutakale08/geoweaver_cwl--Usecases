# eddy_detection_geoweaver

This is the workflow in Geoweaver replicated from the JPL notebook. The workflow aims to train a machine learning model and use it to detect ocean eddies from remote sensing imagery automatically. The source satellite data include https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-sea-level-global?tab=overview.
